# Starting points


Starting with the [Frogfrogfrog Project](https://pippinbarr.com/cart253/topics/making/examples/frogfrogfrog.zip). Add a minimum of a further **five** (but ideally more) new features to the experience. Examples might include:

- A scoring system.
- New kinds of fly movement.
- Visually bringing the fly back to the frog’s mouth on capture.
- A title, instructions, and ending screen.
- A new control system.
- Visual effects.
- Can change the coding to be more modular given the new functions material.

- Randomly sized flies that give player different scores.
- Random faster flies.
- Different coloured flies that give play power ups (making tongue move faster) / power downs.
    - Blue flies that make the tongue move faster because it’s the frog’s favourite snack lol.
    - Purple flies that make the tongue slow.
    - Horrible brown fly that deducts points.
- Non-flies that take away score or stop the player from controlling the frog for a few seconds.
    - Like random squares of trash or something that takes away some of the score and stops the player from moving for a bit.
- Catching flies consecutively makes them spawn at a faster rate?
- Sound effects for catching the fly, etc.
- Purchase Menu
    - State for purchase menu
    - Power ups and cosmetics
    - Using the distance function to sense where the mouse would be for purchases.
- Different rounds (with screens) that add more of these features as you go.
